# My Dotfiles

I have two computer running macOS. I use these dotfiles to make them operate the same way. I pulled the contents of this directory from all over the internet. I try to refer to the resources that I used whenever I can.

To download:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/garrettj403/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

To install:
```bash
sh ~/.dotfiles/link.sh
```
